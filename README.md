SYNOPSIS:

With the advent of digital media, physical music products such as compact discs have become a thing of the past. An unfortunate side effect of this evolution has been the extinction of liner notes and, along with them, proper credits for the musicians who played on the recordings. In the absence of liner notes or an updated online database of credits, it is almost as if the recording never happened. Thus, in the new digital landscape, musicians are largely on their own when it comes to showcasing the work that they have done.

As a professional cellist, I have recorded on numerous musical projects over the past 15 years. These range from major label acts to low budget indie records. In an effort to 1) remember the work that I've done, and 2) display this work for others, I built a simple website on Wix.com. However, the tedious interface has often been a deterrent to keeping the content up to date. In 2018, despite having played on numerous albums since, the latest entry was from 2016. When I look at the websites of my musician friends, I see a similar trend.

Musician Credits is an attempt to provide a simple and elegant interface for musicians like myself to showcase our work for others, particularly potential employers. The app allows users to create an account, log in, add a recording, and edit or delete said recording, all via form entries (no need to deal with HTML or anything resembling code). There are options to provide links to YouTube and/or Spotify as well as album art. Best of all, the interface is responsive and mobile friendly.

Musicians of the world, unite and take over.
